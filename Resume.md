## Summary

Immediately after graduation I started at Cisco and rapidly learned Microservices and Go; traveled the world attending conferences, advocating for developers and gave my first presentation in Japan. Since then, I’ve collaborated with a variety of team sizes writing well documented and tested REST APIs. Also, focused on small details at every level from handling scale to UX/UI, trained ability to break down vague deliverables to actionable tasks. Thoroughly enjoyed all things craft ranging from coffee, wood-shop, and more. Physical and mental fitness are deeply important to me; always practicing lifelong learning. 

Seeking new role that will challenge and expand my knowledge in full stack engineering, and further leadership and growth opportunities with a collaborative team.
